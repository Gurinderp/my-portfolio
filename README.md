<h1>Purpose</h1>
<h3>The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase some of my skills and develop my presence in the development community. Creating the portfolio is also a way for me to implement my skills in a way I think would best describe me.</h3>
<h1>Participants</h1>
<h3>**Gurinderpreet Singh**</h3>
<h3>Since this is a solo project meant to showcase who I am and what I know, this repository is not open for contributions from others.</h3>
<h1>Challenges</h1>
<h3>Creating a website based on my own requirements instead of the guidelines provided by a homework assignment did challenge me to design something within my capabilities while still trying to push myself to implement new methods or technologies I have not previously used</h3>
<h3>As a relevantly new developer, my vision exceeds my capabilities and exceeds the amount of time I would like to put into this portfolio.</h3>
<h1>Future Goals</h1>
<ul>
<li>Improvements in overall design to create a visually appealing display</li>
<li>Improvements to responsive design for better flow in various sized screens</li>
<li>Additional projects to better showcase the development of my skills</li>
</ul>
<h3>As I continue my journey through this field and gain more knowledge and understanding, I hope to improve the mark I leave in this digital world.</h3>
